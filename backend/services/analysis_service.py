"""Analysis orchestration service (Delivery Brief §7, §9.3).

Defines the boundary between HTTP concerns (routes in ``backend/main.py``) and
the inference/consent logic:

* ``predict_one`` / ``predict_batch`` (``backend.services.predictor``) are the
  low-level model port.
* This module owns the *product* rules that wrap inference for a student:
  consent enforcement, risk computation, alert/notification side-effects, and
  audit. Routes stay thin and simply translate the result (or exception) to an
  HTTP response.

Boundary rules (enforced here, not scattered across routes):

* **Consented student analysis** — analysing a specific student's content
  (``run_consented_student_analysis``) requires an ACCEPTED, non-expired
  consent on record when ``ENFORCE_CONSENT_ANALYSIS`` is on.
* **Self-serve analysis** (``/api/analysis/text|image``) is the student running
  the model on their own input; no institutional consent is required.
* **Analysis-staff handle analysis** (``/api/platforms/*``) targets arbitrary
  public handles supplied by staff; no student consent applies.
